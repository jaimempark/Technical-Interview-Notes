brute force is too slow and does not pass all test cases

Collections.frequency and Collections.max are too slow

Can this be done while iterating through the list only once? Yes.

	make a copy q[], make 2 ints for max and frequency, make a dictionary(HashMap<Integer, Integer>)

1. Go through numbers[] in reverse order for(int i = numbers.length()-1; i > -1; i--)

2. if the current value in the for loop is the biggest we've seen so far, set max to that value and frequency to 1

3. if the current value == max, then frequency++

4. at the end of the loop, store the index and frequency into the dictionary <index, frequency>

5. now fill q with the respective values q.set(i, dict.get(q.get(i)))

numbers = [5,3,3,2,4]
q = [3,4,5,2]

copy of list = [1,2,1,1,1]

answer = [1,1,1,2]

what is q?

hashmap ((4,1),(3,1),(2,1),(1,2),(0,1))
